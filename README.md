# Machine-Learning-Project
Here, we're leveraging customer behavior data to recommend newer, more efficient plans that offer better value for our users: Smart or Ultra. By developing a model which predicts the best-suited plan with an accuracy threshold of 0.75, we aim to support our subscribers who are still using the legacy plans.
